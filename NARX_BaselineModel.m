% Prepare the Data for Training and Simulation
% The function PREPARETS prepares timeseries data for a particular network,

% states. Using PREPARETS allows you to keep your original time series data
% unchanged, while easily customizing it for networks with differing
% numbers of delays, with open loop or closed loop feedback modes.

% Step-Ahead Prediction Network
% For some applications it helps to get the prediction a timestep early.
% The original network returns predicted y(t+1) at the same time it is
% given y(t+1). For some applications such as decision making, it would
% help to have predicted y(t+1) once y(t) is available, but before the
% actual y(t+1) occurs. The network can be made to return its output a
% timestep early by removing one delay so that its minimal tap delay is now
% 0 instead of 1. The new network returns the same outputs as the original
% network, but outputs are shifted left one timestep.
